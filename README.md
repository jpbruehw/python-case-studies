## Assignment Overview

The principal assignment for this project is to create three Python case studies with industry relevant applications that fit into the Master of Science in Banking and Finance program at HSLU.

## Project Deliverables

The two main deliverables for this project are coded solutions to each outlined case study and a written report. The written report contains several sections. The first section gives an overview of the technological changes happening in the finance industry and how they affect aspiring finance professionals.

The next section outlines why finance students should learn Python in order to remain competitive in the changing finance landscape. The subsequent portion then outlines why case studies are the best way for finance students to learn Python (beyond gaining a grasp of the basic syntax).

Next, the report shows how to construct an effective case study and then gives a detailed overview of each of the three case studies produced for this assignment. Each case study contains a short summary of a sample solution along with the accompanying code.

Each case study has a fully coded solution as well as detailed comments explaining each block of code. The code can be used to compare solutions to or as a general guide for how students should approach structuring their code.

It should be noted that the provided code files are by no means the only way to achieve the desired results of the case studies. The case studies were designed to have many valid approaches in order to challenge participants to think critically

## The Case Studies

### Assumptions and Considerations:

The main assumption of case studies is that participating students have a basic grasp of the Python syntax. With that in mind, the coding portions of each case study are structured to take between 10-15 hours. The next assumption is that the participating students have a solid grasp of statistical concepts necessary for financial analysis.

### Case Study Deliverables:

Each case study has two deliverables: the code itself and a written report of the findings. The code should be heavily commented and be interpretable to someone who has not worked on the codebase before. The second deliverable is a written report that explains the approach to data collection/processing, a detailed outline of the main code blocks, and a summary of the findings.

### Outline of Each Case Study:

#### Case Study 1: Binary Classification to Predict Credit Default

This case uses a publicly available dataset from a Portuguese bank which has several customer metrics as well as whether the client is currently in default or not. The main tasks are to clean/prepare the data, then use a logistic regression model with various penalties to predict default. The students should then use the results of their analysis to give concrete actionable advise to the bank's loan officers.

#### Case Study 2: Monte Carlo Simulation of a Stock Portfolio

This case study gives students the opportunity to construct a portfolio of stocks and create a Monte Carlo simulation. The goal is to then create a plot of the possible paths and analyze the results of the simulation. No short selling should be assumed. Students should then use the results of their analysis to construct an ideally weighted portfolio, estimate the returns and volatility, then finally give a buy or sell recommendation on their portfolio.

#### Case Study 3: Cross Sectional Analysis of Stock Returns

This case study gives students the opportunity to explore the relationships between various economic indicators and the returns of a stock market index or ETF. Students will first collect data for both the chosen target variable and the economic indicators. Then, students will prepare the data and choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm to predict the target variable's return. Finally, students should then produce a plot of the predicted returns vs. the actual returns.
